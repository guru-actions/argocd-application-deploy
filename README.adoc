= argocd-application-deploy

Deploy or validate an Argo CD application using Git or Helm sources. This CloudBees custom action authenticates to an Argo CD instance, creates or updates an application, and optionally supports dry-run mode for validation.

== Features
	•	Supports Git and Helm as sources
	•	Optionally performs a dry-run (diff) instead of applying
	•	Outputs Argo CD sync status and application UI link
	•	Basic input validation and optional debug logging

== Example Usage

- name: Deploy via Argo CD
  uses: ./path/to/argocd-application-deploy
  with:
    serverurl: https://argocd.example.com
    user: admin
    credential: ${{ secrets.ARGOCD_PASSWORD }}
    projectname: example-project
    applicationname: my-app
    repourl: https://github.com/myorg/myrepo.git
    targetrevision: main
    repopath: apps/my-app
    destnamespace: default
    deploytype: git
    dryrun: false
    debug: true

== Dry-Run Mode

If you set dryrun: true, the action will:
	•	Authenticate to Argo CD
	•	Run an Argo CD diff (dry-run) for the specified application
	•	Exit without applying any changes

This is useful for validating updates or verifying if anything would change.

== Debug Mode

If debug: true, the shell script will output verbose command traces (set -x). Use this when troubleshooting the action.

== Notes
	•	For Git sources, repopath is mandatory.
	•	For Helm sources, chartname must be provided.
	•	The Argo CD application will be created or updated (upsert=true) with automated sync enabled (including prune and selfHeal).

== Development

The included setup.sh is a helper script for local testing. It is not required for CloudBees platform usage.
